        Jaundice occurs when the liver stops functioning correctly and bilirubin levels build up in the body creating a yellowish tint in the skin and eyes. Diagnosing jaundice in newborns and adults in developing countries is very difficult and very unlikely since there are often times no medical professionals around and tests are expensive. This app uses a cellphoneâ€™s camera to potentially diagnose jaundice in newborns using image recognition to detect discoloration in the skin and eyes.

        Jaundice is a condition that affects about 60% of newborn infants (about 80% of premature infants), and if left untreated can lead to brain damage or death.
